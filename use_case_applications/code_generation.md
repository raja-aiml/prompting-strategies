### Code Generation Use Case

**Recommended Techniques:** Chain-of-Thought combined with Step-back Prompting for robust solutions.

**Example Prompt:**
```
I need to write a function that identifies potential duplicate customer records in a database.
Before coding, take a step back and consider:
1. What defines a "potential duplicate"?
2. What edge cases should be handled?
3. What performance considerations matter for 100k+ records?
Then, think through your solution step by step before providing code.
```
