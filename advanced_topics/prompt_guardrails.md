### Prompt Guardrails

**Definition:** Structured instructions that reduce harmful, biased, or non-compliant outputs.

**Techniques:**
- Output constraints (e.g., "Ensure compliance with financial regulations")
- Content filtering ("Exclude violent content")
- Bias mitigation ("Represent diverse perspectives")

**Example Guardrail Prompt:**

2. Include risk disclosures for all recommendations
3. Do not make specific return predictions
4. Clarify that this is not financial advice
```
