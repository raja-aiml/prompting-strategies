### Multimodal Prompting

**Definition:** Adapting prompting techniques to work with inputs and outputs beyond text, such as images or audio.

**Examples:**
- Chain-of-Thought with images: "Analyze this picture step by step: 1) Identify objects, 2) Describe relationships."
- Role-based prompts for audio analysis: "As a sound engineer, evaluate this recording."

**Tip:** Clearly specify how the model should reference each modality and what format responses should take.
