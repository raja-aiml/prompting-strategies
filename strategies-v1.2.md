## Framework Layers

### 1. Core Foundation

*Fundamental building blocks for effective prompt engineering in networking contexts*

#### Zero-shot Prompting

**Purpose:** Direct instruction without examples, relying on pre-trained knowledge

**Cost Profile:** Low (single prompt, minimal tokens)

**Best For:**
- Well-defined networking concepts within model capabilities
- Simple protocol explanations or configurations
- Token-constrained scenarios in technical documentation

**When NOT to Use:**
- Complex Cisco-specific configurations model may not understand
- Multi-step network troubleshooting problems
- Specific output format requirements for network documentation

**Template:**
```
[Networking task instruction]

[Network context or topology]
```

**Example:**
```
Explain the difference between OSPF and EIGRP routing protocols in three concise paragraphs, focusing on their key characteristics and use cases.

[No additional context needed]
```

**Success Tips:**
- Be explicit about desired technical depth and format
- Include clear criteria for network scenarios
- Use precise networking terminology

**Notes:**
- Uses model's pre-trained networking knowledge [cite: 84]
- Foundation for many other networking prompting techniques [cite: 87]

#### Few-shot Prompting

**Purpose:** Learning from networking examples provided in the prompt

**Cost Profile:** Medium (longer prompts, multiple configuration examples)

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:** High value for complex Cisco configurations, diminishing returns after 5-7 examples

##### Subtypes

**One-shot**
- **Description:** Single networking example demonstration
- **Cost:** Low-Medium
- **Template:**
  ```
  [Network configuration task instruction]
  
  Example:
  Input: [network scenario example]
  Output: [configuration or solution example]
  
  Now complete this:
  Input: [actual network scenario]
  Output:
  ```

**Few-shot**
- **Description:** Multiple networking examples (typically 3-5)
- **Cost:** Medium
- **Template:**
  ```
  [Network troubleshooting task instruction]
  
  Example 1:
  Symptom: [network issue example 1]
  Solution: [troubleshooting steps example 1]
  
  Example 2:
  Symptom: [network issue example 2]
  Solution: [troubleshooting steps example 2]
  
  Now diagnose this:
  Symptom: [actual network issue]
  Solution:
  ```

**Best For:**
- Establishing consistent network configuration formats
- Clarifying network troubleshooting approaches
- Tasks with clear networking patterns

**Success Tips:**
- Use diverse network scenarios covering edge cases
- Order examples from simple to complex network topologies
- Mix up vendor types and protocol examples in classification tasks

**Example:**
```
Classify these network issues as Layer 1, Layer 2, or Layer 3 problems.

Example 1:
Symptom: "Interface shows up/down status, no cable issues detected"
Classification: Layer 2

Example 2:
Symptom: "Cable unplugged, interface shows down/down status"
Classification: Layer 1

Now classify this:
Symptom: "Ping fails between VLANs, but intra-VLAN communication works"
Classification:
```

**Notes:**
- Builds context and demonstrates desired network analysis structure [cite: 104]
- Crucial best practice for networking: "Provide configuration examples" [cite: 351]

#### System Prompting

**Purpose:** Behavior configuration for network engineering context and expertise level

**Cost Profile:** Low (typically persistent across networking sessions)

**Template:**
```
You are a [Cisco networking role]. Follow these guidelines:
1. [Technical guideline 1]
2. [Security guideline 2]
3. [Best practice guideline 3]
...
```

**Example:**
```
You are a senior Cisco network engineer with CCIE certification. Always provide configurations following Cisco best practices, include security considerations, and explain the reasoning behind design decisions. Format all router configurations in proper Cisco IOS syntax.
```

**Best For:**
- Setting consistent networking expertise level across sessions
- Cisco-specific configuration standards and security practices
- Global output formatting for network documentation

**Limitations:**
- Instructions may be forgotten in very long troubleshooting sessions
- Conflicts between system networking context and user requirements can confuse model

**Success Tips:**
- Keep system prompts focused on specific Cisco expertise level
- Restate critical networking standards for long configuration sessions

**Notes:**
- Controls technical depth, configuration style, security considerations [cite: 136, 142, 140]
- Useful for maintaining Cisco best practices and security standards [cite: 149]

### 2. Context Engineering

*Methods for establishing specific network contexts and engineering perspectives*

#### Role Prompting

**Purpose:** Assigns specific networking persona or Cisco expertise level for the LLM to adopt

**Cost Profile:** Low-Medium

**Template:**
```
As an experienced [Cisco networking role], [network task instruction]. Incorporate specialized knowledge typical of this certification level and role.
```

**Example:**
```
As a Cisco TAC Level 4 engineer with expertise in enterprise routing and switching, analyze the following network convergence issue and provide a systematic troubleshooting approach including specific show commands and potential root causes.
```

**Model Performance Variations:**
- **GPT Models:** Strong response to detailed Cisco role descriptions and certification levels
- **Claude:** Excellent at maintaining consistent network engineering persona throughout troubleshooting sessions
- **Gemini:** Good at technical networking reasoning, less consistent with creative network design personas

**Best For:**
- Network troubleshooting requiring specific Cisco expertise
- Professional network documentation with certification-level conventions
- Network design tasks requiring specific experience level

**Limitations:**
- May introduce vendor bias toward Cisco solutions when multi-vendor needed
- Not ideal when multiple networking perspectives (security, infrastructure, application) required

**Success Tips:**
- Specify Cisco certification level clearly (CCNA, CCNP, CCIE)
- Provide relevant network topology context the expert would consider

**Notes:**
- Influences technical depth, Cisco-specific knowledge, and troubleshooting methodology [cite: 161]

#### Contextual Prompting

**Purpose:** Provides specific network topology, device information, or environmental constraints

**Cost Profile:** Variable (can significantly increase token usage with large network diagrams and configurations)

**Template:**
```
Network Context:
[topology information]
[device specifications]
[current configurations]

Network Challenge: [specific issue or task]
```

**Example:**
```
Network Context:
- Topology: 3-tier campus network with core-distribution-access layers
- Core: 2x Catalyst 9500 switches in VSS
- Distribution: 4x Catalyst 9300 switches
- Access: 48x Catalyst 9200 switches
- Routing: OSPF Area 0 core, Area 1 distribution
- VLANs: 50 user VLANs, 10 server VLANs
- Current Issue: Intermittent connectivity to VLAN 100 servers

Network Challenge: Design a systematic troubleshooting approach for this connectivity issue.
```

**Best Practices:**
- Prioritize most relevant network topology information first
- Use structured formats for complex network contexts (ASCII diagrams, device lists)
- Place critical network state information near beginning of prompt

**Best For:**
- Model lacks necessary network topology knowledge
- Keeping consistent context across long troubleshooting sessions
- Complex network design tasks requiring specific environmental constraints

**Limitations:**
- Network diagrams and configurations consume significant token budget
- Context must be relevant and concise for specific networking task

**Notes:**
- Helps model understand network topology nuances and tailor solutions [cite: 126]
- Can be dynamic and task-specific for different network scenarios [cite: 133]

#### Analogy-based Prompting

**Purpose:** Explaining complex networking concepts by comparing to familiar real-world scenarios

**Cost Profile:** Low-Medium

**Template:**
```
Explain [complex networking concept] as if it were [familiar real-world scenario]. Highlight how the network elements correspond to real-world components.
```

**Example:**
```
Explain how OSPF link-state routing works as if it were a GPS navigation system where each router is like a GPS device sharing road condition information with all other GPS devices in the network.
```

**Best For:**
- Technical communication of Cisco concepts to non-network professionals
- CCNA-level educational explanations
- Making abstract networking protocols concrete for certification study

**Limitations:**
- Networking analogies might introduce misconceptions if stretched too far beyond protocol reality
- Not ideal when precise Cisco CLI syntax and configuration details required

**Success Tips:**
- Choose analogies familiar to your audience's technical background
- Explicitly map each networking component to real-world analogy element

### 3. Reasoning Architecture

*Structured approaches to enhance network troubleshooting and design reasoning*

#### Step-back Prompting

**Purpose:** Improves network problem-solving by considering broader network principles before specific configurations

**Cost Profile:** Medium (additional reasoning step)

**Template:**
```
[Network problem statement]

Before providing the solution, take a step back and consider:
1. What are the broader network design principles at play?
2. What OSI layer is most likely involved?
3. What assumptions about the network topology might be incorrect?

After this analysis, provide the detailed solution.
```

**Failure Modes:**
- **Over-generalization:** Can lead to irrelevant broad networking theory discussions
- **Relevance drift:** Stepping back too far from specific Cisco configuration issue

**Diagnostics:** Monitor for relevance to original network problem; check if analysis adds troubleshooting value

**Best For:**
- Strategic network design decisions and architecture planning
- Avoiding tunnel vision on complex multi-layer network issues
- CCIE-level problem analysis requiring holistic thinking

**Example:**
```
A company's branch office reports intermittent connectivity issues to the data center during peak hours.

Before providing the solution, take a step back and consider:
1. What are the broader network design principles for WAN connectivity?
2. What factors could cause intermittent rather than persistent issues?
3. What assumptions about bandwidth, routing, or QoS might be incorrect?

After this analysis, provide a systematic troubleshooting approach.
```

**Notes:**
- Activates relevant networking background knowledge and design principles [cite: 171]
- Useful for critical thinking and avoiding common network troubleshooting biases [cite: 173, 175]

#### Chain of Thought (CoT)

**Purpose:** Improves network troubleshooting by generating step-by-step analysis leading to root cause

**Cost Profile:** Medium-High (longer outputs, more detailed analysis)

**Pattern:** "Let's troubleshoot this network issue step by step."

**Template:**
```
[Network problem statement]

Troubleshoot this network issue step by step, showing your reasoning at each layer of the OSI model.
```

**Model Performance Comparison:**
- **GPT-4:** Excellent at complex multi-layer network analysis and Cisco-specific troubleshooting
- **Claude:** Strong logical consistency in network troubleshooting, good at catching configuration errors
- **Smaller Models:** May struggle with complex routing protocol interactions and advanced Cisco features

**Common Failure Modes:**
- **Layer jumping:** Skipping OSI layers without systematic analysis
- **Configuration assumptions:** Assuming default configurations without verification
- **Vendor confusion:** Mixing Cisco syntax with other vendor commands

**Diagnostics:** Check if each troubleshooting step follows logical network analysis; verify Cisco command syntax

**Best For:**
- Network troubleshooting and root cause analysis
- Multi-step Cisco configuration tasks
- CCNP/CCIE level problem solving

**When NOT to Use:**
- Simple show command queries
- Creative network design brainstorming
- When token efficiency critical for basic configurations

**Best Practices:**
- Set temperature to 0 for systematic troubleshooting paths [cite: 438, 439]
- Ensure solution follows logical network analysis steps [cite: 436]
- Request specific Cisco show commands at each step

**Example:**
```
Users in VLAN 200 cannot access the internet, but internal network access works fine.

Troubleshoot this network issue step by step:
1. Verify physical layer connectivity
2. Check data link layer (VLAN configuration)
3. Examine network layer (IP addressing and routing)
4. Analyze transport layer and above if needed

Provide specific Cisco show commands for each step.
```

**Notes:**
- Enhances network troubleshooting methodology and improves accuracy [cite: 194, 196]
- Can be combined with few-shot examples of similar network issues [cite: 192]

#### Self-Consistency

**Purpose:** Enhances network design reliability through multiple solution approaches and validation

**Cost Profile:** High (multiple design iterations, 3-10x base cost)

**Cost-Benefit Decision Matrix:**
- **Critical infrastructure design:** Worth the cost for enterprise core networks
- **Creative network concepts:** Usually not cost-effective for brainstorming
- **Routing protocol selection:** High value for complex multi-protocol environments
- **Basic switch configuration:** Overkill for standard access port configs

**Template:**
```
[Network design challenge]

Generate 5 independent network design approaches without referring to previous solutions. Then identify the most consistent and robust design, explaining why it's likely the best choice for this network environment.
```

**Implementation:** Generate 5-10 network design responses, select by technical consensus and best practices alignment

**Best For:**
- Critical network infrastructure design requiring high reliability
- Network architecture decisions with multiple valid approaches
- Routing protocol selection and network optimization with verifiable outcomes

**Limitations:**
- Not suited for creative network design tasks with no single optimal solution
- Consumes significantly more tokens for complex network scenarios

**Success Tips:**
- Request distinct design approaches for each iteration (redundancy, performance, cost-optimized)
- Use odd number of solutions to avoid ties in technical recommendations

**Example:**
```
Design a redundant campus network for a 500-user organization with high availability requirements.

Generate 5 different network design approaches considering:
1. Layer 2 vs Layer 3 access design
2. Spanning tree vs routing redundancy
3. Different vendor equipment options
4. Cost vs performance trade-offs
5. Scalability considerations

Then select the most robust design and explain your reasoning.
```

**Notes:**
- Improves network design reliability over single-approach solutions [cite: 224]
- Involves multiple design iterations, increasing analysis depth [cite: 224]

#### Tree of Thoughts (ToT)

**Purpose:** Explore multiple network troubleshooting or design paths simultaneously in decision tree structure

**Cost Profile:** Very High (exponential with decision tree depth)

**Template:**
```
[Network challenge statement]

Consider multiple approaches to solving this network challenge:
1. First explore the routing-focused approach...
2. Then explore the switching-focused approach...
3. Finally explore the security-focused approach...

For each approach, evaluate technical merits, implementation complexity, and potential risks. Then select the most promising approach for detailed implementation.
```

**Best For:**
- Complex network optimization requiring exploration of multiple technical paths
- Network design scenarios with multiple valid architectural approaches
- CCIE-level problems requiring comprehensive analysis of design alternatives

**When NOT to Use:**
- Simple network configurations with obvious implementation methods
- Tight budget constraints for routine network tasks
- Real-time network troubleshooting requiring immediate resolution
- When limited by context window for complex network topologies

**Success Tips:**
- Explicitly define how to evaluate each network approach (performance, security, cost, scalability)
- Ensure branches represent distinct technical approaches (Layer 2 vs Layer 3, routing protocols, redundancy methods)
- Request explicit comparison of technical pros/cons for each approach

**Example:**
```
Optimize network performance for a data center with high east-west traffic patterns.

Consider three different optimization approaches:
1. Leaf-spine architecture approach with VXLAN overlay
2. Traditional 3-tier with enhanced inter-VLAN routing
3. Hyper-converged infrastructure with software-defined networking

For each approach, analyze:
- Traffic flow efficiency
- Scalability implications  
- Implementation complexity
- Cost considerations
- Vendor dependencies

Then select the optimal approach and provide detailed implementation plan.
```

**Notes:**
- Model can explore different network architectures, evaluate trade-offs, and select optimal designs [cite: 245]
- Suited for complex network challenges requiring comprehensive technical exploration [cite: 243, 247]

#### ReAct Framework

**Purpose:** Combines network analysis reasoning with tool usage for systematic troubleshooting

**Cost Profile:** Variable (depends on diagnostic tool usage and iteration cycles)

**Pattern:** Thought → Action (diagnostic command) → Observation (command output analysis) → Repeat until resolution

**Template:**
```
To troubleshoot this network issue, alternate between:
1. Thought: Analyze current network state and determine next diagnostic step
2. Action: Execute specific show command or diagnostic tool
3. Observation: Interpret the command output and assess findings
4. Repeat until you identify the root cause and solution

[Network problem statement]
```

**Common Failure Modes:**
- **Command selection errors:** Using inappropriate show commands for the suspected issue
- **Diagnostic loops:** Repeating same commands without progressing toward resolution
- **Context loss:** Forgetting previous command outputs in multi-step troubleshooting

**Diagnostics:** Monitor command diversity and logical progression, track movement toward root cause identification

**Best For:**
- Network troubleshooting requiring systematic diagnostic command sequences
- Multi-step network analysis requiring external tool integration
- Complex routing or switching issues requiring iterative investigation

**Limitations:**
- Overkill for simple connectivity tests or basic show commands
- Requires careful organization of thoughts, commands, and output analysis

**Success Tips:**
- Be specific about available Cisco diagnostic commands and tools
- Include clear criteria for when troubleshooting is complete

**Example:**
```
Troubleshoot OSPF neighbor adjacency issues in a multi-area network.

Thought: Need to verify OSPF neighbor status and identify why adjacencies aren't forming
Action: show ip ospf neighbor
Observation: [Analyze neighbor states and identify missing adjacencies]
Thought: Based on neighbor states, need to check OSPF interface configuration
Action: show ip ospf interface brief
Observation: [Analyze interface states and area assignments]
[Continue until root cause identified]
```

**Notes:**
- Mimics expert network engineer problem-solving by combining analysis with systematic diagnostic commands [cite: 249]
- Requires careful management of command sequences and output interpretation [cite: 273]

    "model": "string",
    "management_ip": "string",
    "role": "string",
    "vlans": ["array of vlan objects"]
  }],
  "connections": [{
    "source_device": "string",
    "source_interface": "string",
    "destination_device": "string",
    "destination_interface": "string"
  }]
}
```

**Notes:**
- Benefits for network automation: consistent device data, relationship mapping, automated validation [cite: 413, 414]

#### JSON Repair

**Purpose:** Handling potentially malformed JSON output from network configuration and documentation tasks

**Tools:**
- json-repair library (Python)
- Network automation validation scripts

**When Needed:**
- Token limit truncation during large network configuration generation [cite: 419, 420]
- Complex nested network topology JSON structures

**Approach:**
1. Detect whether network JSON can be parsed
2. Attempt common fixes (closing braces for config blocks, quoting interface names)
3. Revalidate against network schema and regenerate if necessary

**Example:** When generating large campus network documentation in JSON format, the output may be truncated due to token limits, requiring repair of incomplete interface arrays or device configuration blocks.

**Notes:**

#### Instructions over Constraints

**Purpose:** Guiding network models by positive configuration instructions rather than negative constraints

**Principle:** Tell the model what network configuration TO implement rather than what NOT to configure [cite: 370-386]

**Cost Impact:** Positive network instructions often require fewer configuration iterations

**When to Use Constraints:**
- Network security requirements and access control policies
- Compliance with organizational network standards
- Strict formatting for network automation systems

**Networking Examples:**
- **Positive instruction:** "Configure OSPF Area 0 on all core router interfaces with authentication enabled"
- **Constraint alternative:** "Do not leave OSPF interfaces without authentication or in wrong areas"

**Notes:**
- Positive network instructions lead to more complete and secure configurations [cite: 375, 378]
- Security constraints remain valuable for preventing unauthorized network access [cite: 379, 380]

### 6. Advanced Integration

*Complex combinations and specialized applications for network engineering*

#### Combined Prompting Techniques

**Purpose:** Leveraging multiple strategies for comprehensive network analysis and design

**Meta-Pattern Template:**
```
SYSTEM: [Cisco network engineering expertise level and behavior guidelines] [cite: 124]
ROLE: [Specific networking persona, e.g., "You are a CCIE-certified data center architect"] [cite: 127]
CONTEXT: [Network topology: "3-tier campus with 500 users, experiencing performance issues..."] [cite: 125]
EXAMPLES: [Few-shot: Similar network problem & solution examples...] [cite: 101]
REASONING_TRIGGER: [Chain of Thought: "Analyze this network issue layer by layer."] [cite: 190]
TASK: [Specific instruction: "Design three alternative solutions for network optimization..."]
OUTPUT_FORMAT: [Structure: "Provide recommendations in JSON format with keys 'solution_name', 'technical_approach', 'implementation_steps', 'risk_assessment'."] [cite: 142]
VALIDATION_CUE: [Self-check: "Verify all configurations follow Cisco best practices and security requirements."]
```

**Cost-Optimized Selection:**
- **Simple network tasks:** Zero-shot + System prompting (basic show commands, simple configs)
- **Medium complexity:** Few-shot + CoT (VLAN configurations, routing protocol setup)
- **High stakes network design:** Self-Consistency + Human review (core infrastructure, security architecture)
- **Complex troubleshooting:** ToT (if budget allows) or ReAct + diagnostic tools

**Networking-Specific Combinations:**
- Role (CCIE) + Context (topology) + CoT for complex troubleshooting
- System (security focus) + Few-shot (security configs) + Structured output (compliance reports)
- Step-back (architecture principles) + ToT (design alternatives) + JSON schema (implementation plans)

#### Network Automation + Prompting Integration

**Purpose:** Combining network device APIs and configuration management with LLM reasoning

**Template:**
```
Current Network State:
[Retrieved device configurations and status]
[Network monitoring data]

Using ONLY the network information above, analyze the performance issue and recommend specific configuration changes.
Network Challenge: [Specific optimization or troubleshooting task]
```

**Usage Pattern:** Network state data is retrieved from devices and injected into prompt, which then uses CoT, ToT, etc. for analysis

**Best Practices:**
- Clearly separate retrieved network data from analysis instructions
- Specify how to handle missing device information or unreachable network components
- Consider device reboot cycles and maintenance windows when designing network automation prompts

**Integration Examples:**
- Cisco DNA Center API + Network analysis prompts
- SNMP monitoring data + Performance optimization recommendations
