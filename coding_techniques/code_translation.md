### Code Translation Prompts

**Definition:** Converting code from one programming language to another while preserving functionality.

**Prompt Template:**
```
Translate the following [source language] code into [target language].
[code snippet]
```

**Example:**
```
Translate this JavaScript function to Python:
function square(n) {
  return n * n;
}
```

**Tips:**
- Indicate any differences in language idioms or libraries
- Provide the entire code context when possible

**Best For:**
- Migrating legacy codebases to new languages
- Learning how patterns translate across ecosystems

**Limitations:**
- Translated code may not follow idiomatic best practices
- Incompatible language features can lead to incomplete translations

**Advantages:**
- Accelerates porting efforts
- Helps compare syntax differences side by side
