### Code Generation Prompts

**Definition:** Eliciting new code snippets or functions from the model with clear requirements.

**Prompt Template:**
```
Write [language] code that [description of task]. Include comments explaining key steps.
```

**Example:**
```
Write Python code that takes a list of numbers and returns the list sorted in descending order. Include comments.
```

**Tips:**
- Specify the programming language and version
- Mention any libraries or frameworks that should be used
- Provide edge cases or constraints if relevant

**Best For:**
- Automating repetitive code patterns
- Generating boilerplate across multiple languages

**Limitations:**
- May produce insecure or inefficient code if instructions are vague
- Generated code often requires human review

**Advantages:**
- Speeds up prototyping and development
- Useful for learning unfamiliar languages
