### Prompt Engineering Best Practices

1. **Define Success Criteria** – Know what constitutes a good response before you start.
2. **Match Technique to Task** – Choose zero-shot, few-shot, or advanced strategies based on complexity.
3. **Provide Necessary Context** – Supply background information or constraints the model should consider.
4. **Specify Output Format** – Clearly state how the answer should be structured.
5. **Iterate and Test** – Try multiple prompts, measure results, and refine.
