### Model Configuration

**Purpose:** Setting the appropriate model parameters is critical for controlling output style and quality.

**Key Parameters:**
- **Temperature:** Controls randomness. Lower values yield more deterministic responses; higher values encourage creativity.
- **Max Tokens:** Sets the upper limit on response length.
- **Top-K / Top-P:** Sampling strategies to balance diversity and coherence.

**Example Guidance:**
```
Temperature: 0.7
Max Tokens: 200
Top-P: 0.9
```

**Best Practices:**
- Adjust temperature based on how creative or precise you want the output.
- Keep max token limits high enough for complete answers but low enough to prevent runaway responses.
- Experiment with Top-K/Top-P values to fine-tune variability.

**Tips:**
- Document the configuration used for each prompt during testing.
- Revisit settings when migrating to a different model family.
