### Prompt Engineering Basics

**Overview:** Foundational principles that apply to most prompting situations.

**Core Guidelines:**
- **Clarity First:** Use explicit instructions and avoid ambiguous language.
- **Provide Context:** Include relevant background so the model understands the scenario.
- **Specify Format:** Clearly state the desired output structure (bullet points, tables, JSON, etc.).
- **Iterate and Refine:** Test prompts with varied inputs and adjust based on results.
- **Track Experiments:** Keep records of prompt versions, model settings, and outcomes for future reference.

**Example Starter Prompt:**
```
You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question below in two short paragraphs.
Question: [insert question]
```

**Tip:** Start simple, then add constraints or examples if the initial results are off target.
